# 🐳 Introduction to Docker

Docker is a platform that makes it easy to **build**, **ship**, and **run** applications inside lightweight, portable containers.  
It solves the “*works on my machine*” problem by ensuring your application runs the same everywhere — from your laptop to production.

## 🚀 What is Docker?

Docker is a **containerization platform** that allows developers to package applications along with their dependencies into isolated units called **containers**.

### 🔹 Key points:
- Docker uses **containers**, not virtual machines  
- Containers share the host OS kernel  
- They are lightweight and fast  
- They include everything the application needs

## 🎯 Why Use Docker?

### ✔ Consistent Environments  
No more dependency or version conflicts — containers ensure uniform setups everywhere.

### ✔ Faster Development  
Build once → run anywhere.

### ✔ Lightweight  
Containers start instantly and use fewer system resources.

### ✔ Easy Deployment  
Deploy code in seconds using container images.

## 📦 What is a Docker Image?

A Docker image is a **blueprint** of your container.  
It contains:
- Application code  
- Dependencies  
- OS libraries  
- Configurations  

Containers are created *from* images.
